# The synchronizer module to use TI mmWave radars in SAR configuration

This module is built to count the rising edges of the pulses generated by a typical motion controller, where the number of generated pulses corresponds to a certain movement distance in a typical linear scanner. Depending on the sampling time, the module then generates HW trigger pulses for TI's mmWave sensors to capture radar data at predefined sampling intervals.

For detailed information about the synchronizer module and typical scanners used for TI mmWave sensor-based SAR setups, please refer to the following paper:

## How to use the example

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32 SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for power supply and programming

### Pin connections:
In this module:

* GPIO0 is the default pulse input pin, which should be connected to the motion controller that generates pulses.
* GPIO4 is the default radar trigger pin, which should be connected to the radar SYNC_IN pin for HW triggering.

This module also supports a test mode, where an internal pulse generator is being used as:

* GPIO2 is the default output pin of the pulse generator. You need to short GPIO2 and GPIO0 to count the pulses and generate a radar HW trigger over GPIO4.

### Configure the project
This code is developed using ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) v5.0.
